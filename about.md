Hi! My name is Kirby Powell, and I'm happy to welcome you to my site!

So what does that *mean*? Well, for starters, I'm a software developer currently based in Illinois. I got a BA in
Computer Science from a small liberal arts school in Texas, and I've even done some graduate work in CS at 
Northeastern University in Boston. I've also been lucky enough to visit 45 US States, 13 countries (all European so far), and I
speak varying amounts of Czech, German, and Esperanto. As you can probably tell, I like to travel. I'm also really interested in
languages (natural and programming), and video games have always been a weakness. 

Professionally and academically, I'm interested in anything and everything software and code related, with a special interest
in Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Clean Code. This blog very well could end up talking about some, all, or none of the
above things! In the end, I hope that you'll join me and that we can find out together. 

My site is built in the [Daktilo](https://github.com/kronik3r/daktilo) theme for [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
