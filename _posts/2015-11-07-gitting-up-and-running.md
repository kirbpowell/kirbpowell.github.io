First things first, I'm using Git 2.5.0 on the command line, and using https to push and pull from my Two-Factor 
Auth enabled Github account. I'm running all of this on a standard installation of Ubuntu Mate 15.10 (*Wiley Warewolf*) on an old refurbished ThinkPad. 

Now that all of that's out of the way, let's get a run-down of my issues, and how I solved them. This all began shortly after I bought myself a nice and cheap old ThinkPad off a nice guy on Reddit, mainly so that I could have a dedicated Linux environment to work on and get some personal coding done without all the distractions of my gaming-focused Windows machine or the distraction/ownership questions of my work-owned Mac. Of course, there was a ton of set up involved in getting my environment set up the way I wanted, etc. The problems began when I started plugging away on this very website. Once I'd gotten everything set up, modified, and committed, I of course wanted to push up to Github itself. Of course, Github wanted me to log in. That's fine, I thought, sure. 

Github wanted me to log in, which I did (*after an embarassingly long frusrating time wherein I forgot to generate and use a personal-access-token*). Code got pushed, all was well. I got back to work, making a few tweaks here and there, and decided it was time to push my code again. But what's this? Github wants me to log in *again*? This never happened on my work-Mac, and on Windows I'm happy to use the Github desktop program. Alright Github, I'll log in again. But wait, I didn't save my token anywhere. I'll have to generate a new one - I'm sure everything will work out fine this time. Except, as you may have guessed, it didn't. After my third new personal-access-token, I'd had enough. And I decided to take to the web to find out what other people were doing to get around this ridiculously annoying (*if minor*) issue. 

Like most of you, I discovered that the popular solution to this problem was to use









As you can probably tell, I like using Git and Github to do my coding. While this is true both at work
and at home, this is the first time in a long while I've been using Linux at home to do anything related
to github. This led to some fun little frustrations that I'm going to chronicle below for posterity, because
while I was obviously able to figure out my problems and solve them using some google-fu, it wasn't as easy as 
I'd like.
