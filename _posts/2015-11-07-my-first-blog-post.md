Hello everyone! This is, of course, my first post on this new blog!

I've got to be honest with you. I'm not 100% what I'll be using this blog for, but its
been fun setting up Jekyll, finding a theme I like, and messing with it to get a feel
for how this whole 'static-site generator' thing works. So far, I like it! 

As for what this blog could turn into, it could end up housing some of my old travel blog 
posts from my the semester I spent in Prague back in 2014. It could be a place for me to 
chronicle what I learn about CS and Programming Languages in my spare time. Who knows,
I could even discover the joys of creative writing, or crochet. 

Only time will tell, and I hope you'll join me for the journey!
